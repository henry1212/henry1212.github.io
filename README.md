####---UNDER CONSTRUCTION---#### mqtt-sn in raspberry pi 
project: website
Having been using Steve guidance (http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mqtt-sn/) in setting up MQTT-SN GATEWAY and RSMB BROKER, however, it is not working as expected with error in GATEWAY. 
I then found out this blog (https://jpinjpblog.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/trying-mqtt-sn-on-raspberry-pi/). He has also guided it thoroughly and more importantly, the GATEWAY is working.
As blogs or other sources have mentioned, the mqtt and mqtt-sn basic difference in setting up is in mqtt-sn, you have to setup a GATEWAY to BROKER instead of only configuring the BROKER like MQTT.
